# Rocketeer

Information about Rocketeer can be found in the [official documentation](http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/#/docs/docs/I-Introduction/Getting-started).

## This Repo

Rocketeer is not maintained anymore. To be able to still use it the [issue #755](https://github.com/rocketeers/rocketeer/issues/755) had to be patched, this was done by [LenzLueers](https://github.com/LenzLueers/rocketeer). 
As i had another issue with SSH timeout, i increased the timeout and made this repo for myself to be able to install the patched version 
until rocketeer development is picked up again. This repo contains only the modified application source code, no history and no other branches. 

##Installation

composer require leofonic/rocketeer
